;; adapted by Kayleigh Sleath to run (very badly) in a HDDL planner
;; note that this domain is NO LONGER INTENDED TO SOLVE ANYTHING.
;; It has been adapted from a PDDL domain to fit the syntax (but not the semantics) of a HDDL file 
;; in order to test error messages provided by HDDL planning software. 

;; Testing diagnosis of: inconsistent numbers of parameters (line 62)
